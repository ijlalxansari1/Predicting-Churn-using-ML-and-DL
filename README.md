### 📘 Overview

This project investigates **user churn prediction** across social media platforms using the SLAM 2018 dataset. In addition to traditional behavioral modeling, it uniquely integrates **attention engineering**, **digital ethics**, and **data governance** into the machine learning pipeline.

The project is structured as a reproducible data science pipeline using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It aims to go beyond basic churn prediction by raising critical questions:

* *What behavioral signals precede user dropout?*
* *Are we ethically modeling attention and engagement?*
* *How can churn insights be responsibly designed?*

### 🧠 Research Objectives

1. **Model churn behavior** across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat.
2. **Engineer time-based and session-based features** from raw event data.
3. **Develop predictive models**, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM.
4. **Integrate ethical considerations**, such as digital attention, informed consent, and behavioral surveillance.
5. **Visualize churn behaviors** across user types, clients, and platforms.
6. **Support ethical-by-design feature development** in user-facing platforms.

### ⚖️ Ethical Focus Areas

* **Attention Engineering**: Are we optimizing for meaningful engagement or manipulation?
* **Digital Consent**: Are users truly aware of data use?
* **Surveillance vs Insight**: Where does prediction become intrusion?
* **Bias in Churn Modeling**: Are certain user types unfairly flagged?

### 📊 Key Features Extracted

* `avg_time`, `total_time`, `session_count`
* `active_days`, `session_type_counts`, `client_counts`
* Platform-wise churn flags

### 🔍 Sample Visualizations

* Session activity by platform
* Churn vs retention ratio

### 🧩 LSTM Use Case

A deep learning LSTM model was added to learn user session sequences over time. This helps understand how **temporal behaviors influence churn**, and whether early signals are detectable.
